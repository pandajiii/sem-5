# Aim : Implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm 
# Theory : 
# • Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm for classification problems. It is based on Bayes’ probability 
# theorem. It is primarily used for text classification which involves high dimensional training data sets. 
# • The Naive Bayes algorithm is called “naive” because it makes the assumption that the occurrence of a certain 
# feature is independent of the occurrence of other features. 
# Implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithms : 
# We are using the Social network ad dataset. The dataset contains the details of users in a social networking 
# site to find whether a user buys a product by clicking the ad on the site based on their salary, age, and gender. 
# Steps involved for implementation : 
# 1. Importing essential libraries required. 
# 2. Importing of social network ad dataset. 
# 3. Since our dataset containing character variables we have to encode it using LabelEncoder. 4. performing a train test split on our dataset. 
# 5. Next, we are doing feature scaling to the training and test set of independent variables. 6. Training the Naive Bayes model on the training set. 
# 7. Let’s predict the test results. 
# 8. Making the Confusion Matrix 

#Conclusion : we have dealt with the Naive Bayes algorithm, we have covered most concepts of itin machine learning.
